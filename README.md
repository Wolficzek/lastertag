# lasertag
This is simple lasertag project for arduino made in platformio(check http://platformio.org/ for more info).

I used Arduino Pro Mini 3.3V AtMega328 8MHz.

In this code arduino handles: 
1) Single IR diode with trigger and simple ammo system(this gonna be reworked soon).
2) Two way bluetooth communication with android application wnich is still in development and is (or will be) avaliable at my github repo.
3) IR communication using IRremote library, and buzzing while getting shot.

I am still newbie programmer so feel free criticize and contribute :)
